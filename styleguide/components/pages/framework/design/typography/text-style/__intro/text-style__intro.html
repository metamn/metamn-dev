      This website wanted to be very simple and clean yet powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The look and feel was designed to be electric, vibrant, energizing and modern.
    </p>

    <p>
      For that the principles of modern design (Bauhaus) where used.
      Everything was build from bottom up. New elements use only a minimum necessary deviation from a standard base.
    </p>

    <p>
      These typographic settings should reflect this approach.
      Different text styles must differ minimally from each other yet still serve their function.
