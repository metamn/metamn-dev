## Technologies

* Gulp for generating the site and the styleguide
* JSON files for database
* BEM folder structure and naming conventions, together with a generator
* SWIG templating language
* SCSS style pre-processor
* JS except touch events
* Picturefill for responsive images
* Automatic image resize and compression
* KSS for documentation
* A Styleguide in sync with the site

## Overview

We have two sites, one for the portfolio with source files in `site`, and one for
the Styleguide with source files in `styleguide`.
The Styleguide is optional. It can be completely ignored.

The generated files can be found in `dist`. The Styleguide is mounted under `dist\styleguide`
for simplicity.
