## Overview

We have two sites, one for the portfolio with source files in `site`, and one for
the Styleguide with source files in `styleguide`.
The Styleguide is optional. It can be completely ignored.

The generated files can be found in `dist`. The Styleguide is mounted under `dist\styleguide`
for simplicity.
